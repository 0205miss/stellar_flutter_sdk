# SEP-0024 - TransferServerSEP24Service

Helps clients to interact with anchors in a standard way defined by [SEP-0024: Hosted Deposit and Withdrawal](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0024.md).

## Create a TransferServerSEP24Service instance

**By providing the domain hosting the stellar.toml file**

```dart
final transferService = await TransferServerSEP24Service.fromDomain("place.domain.com");
```

This will automatically load and parse the stellar.toml file. It will then create the TransferServerSEP24Service instance by using the transfer server url provided in the stellar.toml file.

**Or by providing the service url**

Alternatively one can create a TransferServerSEP24Service instance by providing the transfer server url directly via the constructor:

```dart
final transferService = TransferServerSEP24Service("http://api.stellar-anchor.org/transfer");
```

## Get Anchor Information

First, let's get the information about the anchor's support for [SEP-24](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0024.md). This request doesn't require authentication, and will return generic info, such as supported currencies, and features supported by the anchor. You can get a full list of returned fields in the [SEP-24 specification](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0024.md#info).

```dart
SEP24InfoResponse infoResponse = await transferService.info();
```

## Fee

If there is a fee and the fee schedule is not complex, the info response already contains the fee data for a given asset.

```dart
double? feeFixed = infoResponse.depositAssets?["USDC"]?.feeFixed;
double? feePercent = infoResponse.depositAssets?["USDC"]?.feePercent;
double? feeMinimum = infoResponse.depositAssets?["USDC"]?.feeMinimum;
print("USDC fixed fee for deposit: $feeFixed");
print("USDC percentage fee for deposit: $feePercent");
print("USDC minimum fee for deposit: $feeMinimum");
```

Otherwise, one can check if the fee endpoint of the anchor is enabled and if so, request the fee from there.

```dart
bool feeEndpointEnabled = infoResponse.feeEndpointInfo?.enabled == true;
if (feeEndpointEnabled) {
    SEP24FeeRequest feeRequest = SEP24FeeRequest();
    feeRequest.operation = "deposit";
    feeRequest.type = "SEPA";
    feeRequest.assetCode = "USD";
    feeRequest.amount = 2034.09;
    feeRequest.jwt = jwtToken;

    SEP24FeeResponse feeResponse = await transferService.fee(feeRequest);
    double? fee = feeResponse.fee;
    print("fee : $fee");
}
```

## Interactive Flows

Before getting started, make sure you have connected to the anchor and received an authentication token, by using the SDKs [WebAuthService](https://github.com/Soneso/pi_flutter_sdk/blob/master/documentation/sdk_examples/sep-0010-webauth.md).
We will use the jwt token in the examples below as the SEP-10 authentication token, obtained earlier.

### Deposit

To initiate an operation, we need to know the asset code.

```dart
SEP24DepositRequest request = new SEP24DepositRequest();
request.assetCode = "USDC";
request.jwt = jwtToken;

SEP24InteractiveResponse response = await transferService.deposit(request);
```

As a result, you will get an interactive response from the anchor.
Open the received URL in an iframe and deposit the transaction ID for future reference:

```dart
String url = response.url;
String id = response.id;
```

### Withdraw

Similarly to the deposit flow, a basic withdrawal flow has the same method signature and response type:

```dart
SEP24WithdrawRequest request = new SEP24WithdrawRequest();
request.assetCode = "USDC";
request.type = "bank_account";
request.jwt = jwtToken;

SEP24InteractiveResponse response = await transferService.withdraw(request);
```

As a result, you will get an interactive response from the anchor.
Open the received URL in an iframe and deposit the transaction ID for future reference:

```dart
String url = response.url;
String id = response.id;
```

### Providing KYC Info

To improve the user experience, the SEP-24 standard supports passing user KYC to the anchor via [SEP-9](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0009.md).
In turn, the anchor will pre-fill this information in the interactive popup.

```dart
SEP24DepositRequest request = new SEP24DepositRequest();
request.assetCode = "USDC";
request.jwt = jwtToken;

StandardKYCFields kycFields = StandardKYCFields();
kycFields.naturalPersonKYCFields = NaturalPersonKYCFields();
kycFields.naturalPersonKYCFields!.emailAddress = "mail@example.com";
kycFields.naturalPersonKYCFields!.photoIdFront = await Util.readFile(path);

request.kycFields = kycFields;

SEP24InteractiveResponse response = await transferService.deposit(request);
```

### Changing Stellar Transfer Account

By default, the Stellar transfer will be sent to the authenticated account (with a memo) that initiated the deposit.

While in most cases it's acceptable, some wallets may split their accounts. To do so, pass additional account (and optionally a memo):

```dart
SEP24DepositRequest request = new SEP24DepositRequest();
request.assetCode = "USDC";
request.account = "G...";
request.memo = "my memo";
request.memoType = "text";
request.jwt = jwtToken;


SEP24InteractiveResponse response = await transferService.deposit(request);
```

Similarly, for a withdrawal, the origin account of the Stellar transaction could be changed.

## Getting Transaction Info

On the typical flow, the wallet would get transaction data to notify users about status updates. This is done via the SEP-24 GET /transaction and GET /transactions endpoint.

```dart
SEP24TransactionsRequest request = SEP24TransactionsRequest();
request.assetCode = "ETH";
request.jwt = jwtToken;

SEP24TransactionsResponse response = await transferService.transactions(request);
List<SEP24Transaction> transactions = response.transactions;
```

Single Transaction:

```dart
SEP24TransactionRequest request = SEP24TransactionRequest();
request.stellarTransactionId = "17a670bc424ff5ce3b386dbfaae9990b66a2a37b4fbe51547e8794962a3f9e6a";
request.jwt = jwtToken;

SEP24TransactionResponse response = await transferService.transaction(request);
SEP24Transaction transaction  = response.transaction;
```
